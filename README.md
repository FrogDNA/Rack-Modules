## GameOfLife

### Display

Left click on an alive cell to kill it. Left click on a dead cell to revive it.

### AUDIO part:

SND out is an audio output (-5V to 5V)

CLK in regulates the Game of Life evolution. Each rising front triggers an update.

WAY is how life finds a way ;) (the input port is 1V/oct, the parameter knob controls a fine tuning)
