## Introduction, or "What this module does"

## The grid

This is the grid. Each darker cell is dead, and each lighter cell is alive. You can find more info about the game of life [there](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
Click on a dead cell to make it alive, click on a living cell to kill it.

You can click the row and column headers to "mute" a whole row or column. Muting individual cells is not possible, and it would not have much sense given how this module outputs (more info on that [here](later). When muting a line, you will notice the header becoming darker, and the line will have a distinctive color.

When a line is muted, you will also notice a change in the scale box.

## The scale box

This box lets you mute all rows or columns producing a certain tone. When all such lines are muted, the button turns green. When only some of them are muted, the button is yellow.
